# M2-System-Carousel-draw

System for drawing items for points  
For the system to work, you need to connect to your base (class, function, etc.). They are marked as TODO   

Setting:
```
$c->price = 100;  // Number of points needed for the draw
$c->items([       // List of items to be won. [ID, Promil] (percentage * 10)
    [100100, 500],
    [100200, 500],
    [100000, 500],
    [100300, 200],
    [100400, 200],
    [100500, 100],
    [30270, 100],
    [50255, 100],
    [50256, 100],
    [50257, 100],
    [50258, 100],
    [50259, 100],
]);
```

If you have a problem with the configuration, I help on discord Alerin#5559
